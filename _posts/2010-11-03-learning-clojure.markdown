title: 'Learning Clojure'
---

I started learning Clojure a couple of weeks ago. Tough my brain is hurting, I must say that I really enjoy it. It is so refreshing! Clojure has been on my radar for a year or two, but <a href="http://blip.tv/file/982823">that video from Rich Hickey</a> gives me the motivation to actually start learning it. I am currently using the <a href="https://github.com/relevance/labrepl">labrepl</a> to practice writing clojure code.  Nice stuff!

Browsing <a href="https://github.com/languages/Clojure">through Github</a>, you can find a couple of really high-quality projects written in Clojure, like <a href="https://github.com/weavejester/compojure">Compojure</a> and <a href="https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen">Leiningen</a>. It always amazes me to see how fast the community can build around a promising new language.

Last week, Eugene Wallingford says that <a href="http://www.cs.uni.edu/~wallingf/blog/archives/monthly/2010-10.html#e2010-10-30T13_01_58.htm">the time is right for functional design patterns</a>.

Who knows?
